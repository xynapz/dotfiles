# xynapz dotfiles 🛠️

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repo! This is where I keep configuration files for my development environment, including editors, Tmux, terminal emulators, and zsh. These dotfiles are setup for my needs but feel free to use it for yourself.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xynapz/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

Then manually copy the files or create a symlink for them.

> Back up any existing configs before copying.
