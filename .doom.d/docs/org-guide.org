** Making Tasks Appear in Agenda

Tasks *only show in timeline views* if they have dates:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Without dates - won't show in C-c a 1/2/7/m
,* TODO With schedule
SCHEDULED: <2024-12-30 Mon>
,* TODO With deadline
DEADLINE: <2024-12-31 Tue>
#+end_src

Tasks *always show* in category views (=d=, =p=, =l=) based on:
- TODO state (=NEXT=, =WAIT=)
- Tags (=:project:=, =:learning:=)

* Date Picker Shortcuts

When scheduling (=C-c C-s=) or setting deadline (=C-c C-d=):

| Key       | Action             |
|-----------+--------------------|
| =.=       | Today              |
| =+1=      | Tomorrow           |
| =+7=      | Next week          |
| =+1m=     | Next month         |
| =S-right= | Next day           |
| =S-left=  | Previous day       |
| =S-down=  | Next week          |
| =S-up=    | Previous week      |
| =RET=     | Confirm            |

* Tags

Add tags at end of heading:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Learn Rust :learning:programming:
,* TODO Deploy v2.0 :project:urgent:
#+end_src

Common tags:
- =:project:= - Active project
- =:learning:= - Study/learning
- =:reading:= - Reading list
- =:urgent:= - High priority
- =:@work:= - Work context
- =:@home:= - Home context

* Properties

Store metadata in property drawers:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Review PR

:SOURCE: [[file:~/code/app.py::42][app.py:42]]
:EFFORT: 30min
:END:
#+end_src

* Refile

Move items to different files/headings:

1. =C-c C-w= on a heading
2. Select destination (fuzzy search)
3. Item moves there

* Archive

When done with old items:

- =C-c C-x C-a= - Archive subtree to =archive.org=
